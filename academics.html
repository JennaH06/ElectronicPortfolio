         <h2>Academic Awards</h2>
           <div class="col-sm-6">
              <p>In May 2023, I was awarded the Outstanding 10th grade House Student award. This means that out of all of the 10th grade students in my Academy, I stood out. This award helped me realize that people are noticing the hard work I put into everything. I used to believe that I just blended in and nobody knew who I was, but now I know that's not true. Everything that I had done in high school had some sort of impact on someone, big or small. I just needed somebody to open my eyes so I could see that.</p>
         <p>The very next year, in May 2024, I was given a second award. The Outstanding Cybersecurity Level 2 award. There are just over 40 students in Cyber Level 2 this year. I was very surprised when I was told. Looking at all my peers, it seemed that some of them deserved it more. This award helped me reflect and really dig deep into what kind of impact I had on others. The other award helped me realize it was there, but I hadn't really thought much of it after that. What was I doing right? What could I improve on? These questions are what helped me at the time and they will also help me improve even more to feel worthy of being given this award.
