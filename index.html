                <p>Hi! My name is Jenna Harrison. I am  currently 17 years old and a student at Waipahu High School. I am also enrolled at Leeward Community College at the same time. I love learning and am very self-motivated. My ability to keep a schedule and stick with it has helped me a lot in my high school years. It allows me to know when I should start working on an assignment and helps me be able to turn everything in on time. Whenever I am given work, I make sure that what I am turning in is my best.</p>
                <p>I was born in Utah and spent 12 years living there. My family and I moved to Maryland in 2015 and spent 3 years there. Ever since, I have lived in Hawaii (almost 3 years). Because I have moved around a few times, I have had the opportunity to meet so many people. Those people have helped me become who I am today. I love hearing about people's interests and their daily lives and I think that has helped me decide who I want to be. From what I want to do for a living to the kind of person I want to be, everything has stemmed from the people I've met and the people I want to be like.</p>
